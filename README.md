First project for UCB bootcamp

We hypothesize that the Covid-19 pandemic had a negative effect on California’s real estate market. Some of the questions we wanted to explore were:
What were the changes in median homes sales price and average monthly rent from before and after covid?
What were the effects on population change in relation to home sales and inventory?
How did the changes in interest rates and financial insecurity created from the pandemic effect the real estate market?

We sourced our housing data from real estate websites Zillow, FRED and Redfin. This data was national data so we cleaned up our data to focus solely on California's six biggest cities and broke it into two different time points: pre-covid (March 2018-Feb 2020) and post-covid (March 2020- March 2023). We observed pronounced dip in average rental prices across all California cities in 2020 in at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The average prices began to rise again to  pre-covid prices by half way through 2021 and have since surpassed pre-covid prices in some cities by the beginning in 2023. We can conclude the pandemic had a volatile effect on average rental prices juxtaposed against the more stable rental prices observed in the years before Covid. In general, average rental prices greatly increased in the years after Covid.

We also accessed US Census and financial data to support our analysis of our housing market data, because other factors, such as population change and interest rates, can lead to changes in the housing market. The financial data we sourced was from FRED and focuis on interest rates.

From the Census data we saw a sharp decrease in California's’ population right at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. It is safe to assume a decreasing population would have an adverse effect on the housing market as there are less people buying housing. To back up our population findings we examined the amount of homes for sale in California to see if more people were selling their homes. Although most cities inventory fluctuate heavily in the years since 2020, we can observe a general decline in the amount of homes for sale in California. Covid caused multiple large businesses, such as Oracle and Tesla, to relocate outside of California. Also many companies have chosen to move their work remotely permanently. These changes in the job market have cause workers to look to relocate as well. Since more people are moving from California, there is less demand for home sales and is reflected in the decreasing  inventory observed in our post-covid data. 

For our interest rate analysis, we analyzed the changes in rates in relation to avaerage home salesprice, and tested our analysis against other major cities. Ultimately, interest rates alone were not the sole contributor of the price movement for single family homes. Some cities showed more correlation than others and went against our initial prediction. For instance in San Francisco, as interest rates reached new highs, home prices followed. When it came to the price movement there were other factors to consider like the effects migration between states. Interest rates were not the sole contributor

Finally, we analyzed overall impact on the real estate market in California. We sourced our data for this from FRED and cleaned it to include only California and for the years we wished to analyze. During the initial months of the pandemic period, there was a very significant drop in Total California Real Estate Earnings. However, the analysis revealed a correlation coefficient value of 0.9178036966871206, indicating a strong positive correlation between years and total earnings. Concluding, despite the dip in 2020, there was no long term effect on CA Real Estate earnings 

We initially hypothesized the Covid-19 pandemic had a negative effect and long lasting effect on California’s real estate market. Through our analysis we can conclude there was detrimental effect on the housing market across sales, inventory, mortgage rate, earnings and monthly rents. However, these negative impacts were short lived as most observations returned to pre-covid levels, or to the predicted level of growth by the end of 2021.

On the other hand, California Resident population has significantly reduced, and while the rate of population decline has slowed, it’s still trending downwards much less returned to predicted levels/growth. This trend falls more in line with our hypothesis. It is unclear what long term effects of decreasing population will have on the housing market, since population is not returning to pre-Covid levels. 

Despite this population decline, our analysis was not able to ultimately prove our hypothesis that the Covid-19 pandemic had a negative and long lasting effect on the total California real estate market.
